# Sort Algoriths Visualization (a.k.a SAV)

The purpouse of this project is to see how sorting algorithms work and to visualize the operations with wich they sort in the hope of understanding them in a better way.

## What this program can do

It can visualize the following algorithms:

- Insertion Sort
- Shaker Sort
- Quick Sort
- Heap Sort
- Merge Sort

The elements that are being swapped are coloured purple.

## How to start the program

**Without SDL2 the program can't start**.

If you have *SDL2* and *SDL2_ttf* installed in your pc you can run the command below.

```shell
make && ./build/sav
```

If you *do not* have it and you use a Linux distrubution you can install it with yout packet manager, for example in arch:

```shell
pacman -S sdl2 sdl2_ttf
```

If you have Windows or MacOS good luck.
